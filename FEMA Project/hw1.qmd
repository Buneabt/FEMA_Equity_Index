# Tip of the week

This is a Quarto document for you to take notes in as you complete this week's homework. In each homework template I'll include a tip for working with .qmd files.

Before you start the assignment:

- Update the header - give it a `title` and put your name in the `author` argument.
- Click the "Render" button in RStudio and then open the rendered `hw1.html` page.
- Then go back and try changing the `theme` argument in the header to something else - you can see other available themes [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html). Notice the difference when you render now!
